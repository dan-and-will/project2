To reach the milestone, we thought about each of the things that we needed to implement,
and then worked through the list until we felt that we got to a working state. We started
with the forwarding table, and then moved on to updating BPDUs, and then enabling and disabling
ports as we got more information. Our first major challenge was handling BPDUs that we sent
coming back from a LAN that the bridge was connected to on multiple ports. Another challenge we
had to deal with was packets circulating throughout the network, and had to rethink our logic
regarding when we should enable and disable ports. To debug our code, we used a mixture of print 
statements and careful examination of the output from the run scripts, looking for behavior that
seemed unexpected or incorrect, and then thought about why it was happening and how to fix it.
For each of the configuration files that was tripping up our code, we also drew out the network
topology to see what's different to narrow down why some configurations succeeded and others 
did not.
